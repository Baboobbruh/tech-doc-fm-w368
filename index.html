        <p class="first-note">Night City is a sprawling cybernetic metropolis where corporations reign supreme, law enforcement is corrupt, and the streets are ruled by gangs and mercenaries. Built on the ashes of the Fourth Corporate War, the city is a chaotic mix of extreme wealth and devastating poverty. Towering megacorp skyscrapers cast long shadows over seedy backstreets filled with black-market cyberware dealers, Fixers, and desperate hustlers trying to carve out a living.
        </p>
        <p class="second-note">
The city is divided into six major districts, each with its own culture and level of lawlessness:
        </p>

        <hr>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Watson</strong> - A once-thriving corporate district, now a scav-ridden den of black-market cyberware and desperate edgerunners. </li>
          <li><strong>Heywood</strong> - A vibrant Latino-dominated community where chombattas look out for each other, but fixers and gangbangers run the real show.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Westbrook</strong> - The high-end glitz and chrome of Night City. If you got eddies to burn, this is where you go to live like a corpo for a night.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Pacifica</strong> - A ghost town turned lawless warzone, where the Voodoo Boys own the Net and the streets answer to no one.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Santo Domingo</strong> - The industrial powerhouse of the city, filled with warehouses, factories, and corpos looking to squeeze every last drop of profit from the workers.  </li>
          <li><strong>City Center</strong> - The beating heart of corporate oppression, where Arasaka and Militech play their endless game of power while the little guys get crushed beneath them
          </li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          Every alleyway, club, and backroom in Night City tells a story, and danger lurks around every neon-lit corner.
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="cyberware">
        <header>CYBERWARE</header>
        <p class="first-note">In Night City, your body is just a starting point. Flesh is weak, chrome is power. Ripperdocs peddle the latest black-market implants, and every merc looking to make a name for themselves needs the right chrome to survive.
        </p>
        <p class="second-note">Cyberware comes in all flavors:
        </p>

        <hr>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Neural Implants</strong> - Boost your synaptic response time, hack security grids, or burn a fool's brain from the inside out.</li>
          <li><strong>Optical Mods</strong> - Enhanced targeting, thermal vision, and augmented HUD overlays to track enemies and scan for loot</li>
          <li><strong>Arm Enhancements</strong> - Mantis Blades for slicing, Gorilla Arms for smashing, and Monowires for the silent kills—choose your flavor of carnage.</li>
          <li><strong>Leg Mods</strong> - Need to outrun a squad of NCPD? Double-jump, charge forward like a cyber-psycho, or land from high-rises like a preem-tier badass.</li>
          <li><strong>Subdermal Armor</strong> - Because sometimes, meat ain't enough to stop a bullet.</li>

          <code>Push your chrome too far, and you risk flatlining your humanity—cyberpsychosis is real, and when a merc goes over the edge, it ain't long before MaxTac rolls in to clean up the mess.
          </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="combat">
        <header>COMBAT</header>
        <p class="first-note">Night City is a meat grinder, and chooms who ain't packing heat don't last long. Whether you're a quickhack maestro, a high-speed katana slicer, or a walking arsenal, every fight is do or die.</p>
        <p class="second-note">There are three major ways to crack skulls:</p>
        
        <hr>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Netrunning</strong> - Slip into the Net, scramble a gonk's cyberware, fry their optics, or force them to eat their own gun. Quickhacks like Overheat, Ping, and Cyberware Malfunction let you drop a squad before they even know you're there.</li>
          <li><strong>Guns & Heavy Combat</strong> - You got power weapons that punch through walls, tech weapons that charge up for a high-powered shot, and smart weapons that let you paint a target and let the bullets do the rest.</li>
          <li><strong>Stealth & Melee</strong> - If slicing and dicing is your thing, grab a thermal katana or rip through a squad with monowire precision. Prefer to go ghost? Cloaking cyberware, silenced pistols, and quick reflexes will keep you off the radar.
          </li>

          <code>And don't forget—if you'are packing serious chrome, you're gonna need preem-level cyberware to keep up. You don't wanna be lagging when a corpo hit squad's on your tail.
          </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="factions">
        <header>FACTIONS</header>
        <p class="first-note">Power shifts fast in Night City, and if you don't know who's pulling the strings, you're just another gonk waiting to get flatlined.</p>
        <p class="second-note">Some of the biggest power players in the city:
        </p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fixers</strong> - The middlemen who deal in secrets, contracts, and high-risk gigs. From Dexter DeShawn to Rogue Amendiares, if you want work, you go through them.</li>
          <li><strong>Gangs</strong> - The Tyger Claws, Maelstrom, Valentinos, and 6th Street—each one a different breed of dangerous. Whether it's high-tech slaughter or old-school blood feuds, these gangs own the streets.</li>
          <li><strong>Arasaka & Militech</strong> - The corpo warlords. Arasaka's got the tech, the assassins, and the deep pockets, while Militech's got guns, AI drones, and an army of mercs. They've been at each other's throats for decades, and Night City is their battleground.</li>

          <code>If you're a merc looking to make a name, you better know who to kiss up to, who to backstab, and when to get the hell out—'cause in this city, loyalty lasts about as long as a preem contract, and the wrong move can put you in an unmarked grave.

      <section class="main-section" id="phantom_liberty">
        <header>PHANTOM LIBERTY</header>
        <p class="first-note">Phantom Liberty drops you into Dogtown, the most cutthroat hellhole in Night City, locked away from the rest of the city and ruled by Kurt Hansen, an ex-Militech warlord with a vice grip on the black market. This ain’t a place for gonks looking for a good time—this is a battlefield where only the sharpest mercs survive.</p>
        <p class="second-note">
          You get tangled in a high-stakes political thriller when you cross paths with Songbird, a rogue netrunner, and Solomon Reed, a deep-cover agent played by Idris Elba. Their mission? Prevent an assassination tied to President Rosalind Myers. But this is Night City—trust is as rare as an honest corpo, and the moment you think you've got a handle on things, the city chews you up and spits you out.
        </p>

        <p>
          New chrome and firepower to play with:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Vehicular Combat</strong> - Strap mounted weapons to your ride, hijack Militech vehicles, and turn the streets into your personal battlefield.</li>
          <li><strong>Black Market Weapons</strong> - Prototype Militech boomsticks, plasma rifles, and EMP launchers—hardware too deadly for the corpos to release legally.</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Airdrops</strong> - Military supply drops crash into Dogtown, but if you want a piece, you gotta fight off merc squads, scavvers, and Hansen's kill squads.</li>
          <code>
            Dogtown is a meatgrinder, and if you’re stepping in, you better be packing the best chrome and the coldest nerves.
